# Sensors
Among Us Hack

In this project, we tried to use a sensor which will measure the water level of a particular area and through this water level, we will come to know about the flood conditions in different areas and thus, will allow us to estimate a time by which rescue team could be sent to save the people affected from these floods in rural areas. This is a website which will be providing you with all the information regarding the different standard flood levels and thus, will allow people to take precautions from these flood-like conditions.
